### Project Overview

 Easy.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt array aggregation as it will be used most when solving actual excel datatypes.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Everything was explained so no particular approach was required. 


### Challenges faced

 The actual challenge I faced was extracting the column from multidimensional array and operations on it with another variable, to which I found the solution on stackoverflow. 


### Additional pointers

 None.
